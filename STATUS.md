## d24 trio results (8xA100 40GB, ~$337 wall-clock)

Sequential trio on a single Lambda instance; baseline included SFT (subsequently `USE_SFT` defaulted to 0 — workflow tweak, not a hardware constraint). All three share the same nanochat commit, seed, and hardware envvars (`USE_FP8=0 WINDOW_PATTERN=L`). MTP needed `DEVICE_BATCH_SIZE=4` (vs 8 for the others) to fit 40GB HBM with k=3 aux softmaxes.

| | baseline | zloss | mtp |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| wandb | `qmsi105c` | `06731h2o` | `b35xnu0d` |
| `DEVICE_BATCH_SIZE` | 8 | 8 | **4** (k=3 softmaxes pushed B=8 to OOM) |
| val/bpb (final) | 0.71609 | 0.72009* | 0.77898 |
| CORE (`base_eval`, full) | 0.250488 | **0.263387** | 0.258635 |
| tok/sec | 291,210 | 288,483 | 260,517 |
| total time | 5h33m | 5h36m | 6h13m |

*zloss val/bpb is inflated by ~0.004 due to an eval-path bug (since fixed) — see below. mtp's batch-size asymmetry preserves total optimization signal (`base_train` holds total batch in tokens constant via grad-accum) but worth noting in any writeup.

### Headline verdicts

- **zloss is a real positive result and should be adopted.** CORE +5.15% with 16 wins / 5 losses / 1 tie across 22 tasks (one-sided sign test dropping the tie: p ≈ 0.013); val/bpb cost is ≈ 0 once the bug is corrected; throughput cost <1%. The CORE gain concentrates on robust high-N tasks (piqa +3.9pp on N=1838, commonsense_qa +3.4pp, lambada +1.7pp, coqa +2.0pp).

- **MTP at our k=3, α=0.3, shared-unembedding config is a net loss at d24.** val/bpb regression got *worse* at scale (+4.17% at d6 → +8.78% at d24), not better as Gloeckle et al. predict. CORE "+3.25%" is essentially one task (boolq +0.111; excluding it, mean Δ across 21 tasks is +0.003 — pure noise). Sign test p ≈ 0.19, not significant. Compute cost +12%. Three rescue paths exist (α=0.1 + k=1 single-aux-head, DeepSeek-MTP architecture, scale to d30+) but none are next-up.

### Eval-path bug in zloss (now fixed)

The original `ZLossGPT.forward` added the scalar z-loss term to the CE tensor on every code path, including `loss_reduction='none'` (the path `nanochat/loss_eval.py` uses for val/bpb). That inflated val/bpb by a constant offset of `z_coeff·E[lse²] / mean_bytes / ln 2` ≈ 0.004 — exactly the originally-observed regression. Fix: `forward` now branches on `loss_reduction != 'mean'`. **Smoke check `(e)` was added to enforce this contract** — the lesson was already documented in [`overlay/README.md`](overlay/README.md), but text-only lessons aren't enforcement. MTP got the contract right because it was written *after* the lesson landed; zloss missed it because the rule postdated its first implementation. The d24 CORE result for zloss is unaffected by this bug — CORE is computed by a separate pipeline.

### Earlier d6/M4 results (kept for reference)

- **`d6_baseline`** (wandb `qdoniwrj`) — `val/bpb` 1.16534. Pure baseline reference.
- **`d6_zloss`** (wandb `szesl4yg`) — `val/bpb` 1.17007 (within noise). tok/sec ~7% under baseline. CORE 0.0361.
- **`d6_zloss_fused`** (wandb `de562k89`, killed at ~300 steps) — Python fused-autograd path is **numerically correct** (bit-exact loss + ~2e-8 grad agreement vs naive) but **~32% slower than baseline** in pure PyTorch. Default flipped to naive; opt in via `ZLOSS_FUSED=1`.
- **`d6_mtp`** (wandb `bcv9920m`) — `val/bpb` 1.21398 (+4.17%). Showed the d24 regression's signature already at toy scale.

Compare any subset (CORE now shows both wandb mid-training subsample and authoritative `base_eval` from local `eval.csv`):

```bash
uv run python -m tools.compare_runs d24_baseline d24_zloss d24_mtp
```

## Suggested sequencing (updated post-d24)

1. **z-loss is settled — adopt as the default for future speedruns.** Single open question worth ablating: turn off the existing logit-softcap (`gpt.py:472`) with z-loss on; the hard cap may now be unnecessary. Cheap d24 ablation, ~$100.
2. **Deep supervision** — depth-axis complement to MTP; folds into the same `MTPGPT` subclass for one combined experiment. Token weighting's **RHO-Loss variant** can fold in here too (shares `forward` surface; needs a reference model that can be added once for both).
3. **Token-level loss weighting** (entropy / focal variants) — pure-loss overlay, no extra model, independent of MTPGPT line. Cheap parallel track.
4. **Differential attention** — independent architecture A/B.
5. **Adaptive sequence length (Part A of adaptive-schedule)** — harness change, but the model needs no edits and Part A is the rare idea that should make the speedrun **faster on wall-clock** at the same final loss. Cheap-ish entry into the harness-change tier.
6. **Online data selection + adaptive batch size (Part B of adaptive-schedule)** — bigger, harness-touching; pursue if earlier results justify it. Both share the copied-`base_train.py` pattern, so fold into a single forked harness. Online data selection is complementary to token weighting (sample-level vs. token-level signal shaping), so worth A/B-ing alone, weighting alone, and combined.

MTP rescue probes (α=0.1+k=1 first) only happen if a follow-up idea raises a specific question that an MTP variant can answer. Don't revisit MTP for its own sake at d24.

**[Tokenizer variants](ideas/tokenizer-variants/README.md)** is a **parallel track**. Infrastructure is now end-to-end ready: `tools/eval_tokenizer.py` harness validated; pristine rustbpe vendored at `sandbox/rustbpe/` (Karpathy@9467d83) with `runs/build_rustbpe.sh` for local builds; parallel-crate variants pattern in `sandbox/rustbpe_variants/`. **Three variants ported** from `veryfansome/nanochat` prior art:

- **`space_digits`** (Python-only) — adds optional leading space before the digit clause in `SPLIT_PATTERN`. Wrapper: `wrappers/tok_train_space_digits.py`. Smoke: `wrappers/smoke_tok_train_space_digits.py`. Uses PyPI rustbpe; no Rust build needed.
- **`force_merges`** (Rust) — forced cross-boundary common-phrase merges (" of the", ", and", etc.) with regex carve-out. Crate: `rustbpe_variants/force_merges/` (`rustbpe_force_merges` module). Data: `rustbpe_variants/force_merges/pairs.py` (FORCED/BLOCKED/DERIVED lists). Wrapper + smoke under `wrappers/`. Build: `VARIANT=force_merges bash runs/build_rustbpe.sh`.
- **`seed_tokens`** (Rust) — morpheme-seeded BPE with constructive merge-chain builder. Crate: `rustbpe_variants/seed_tokens/` (`rustbpe_seed_tokens` module). Data: `rustbpe_variants/seed_tokens/seed_tokens.yaml` (~200 morphemes). Wrapper + smoke under `wrappers/`. Build: `VARIANT=seed_tokens bash runs/build_rustbpe.sh`.
- **`case_marker`** (designed only, not yet implemented) — lossless casing collapse via input preprocessing: cased words → `<|cap|>` / `<|allcaps|>` marker tokens + lowercased base. Pure-Python (~200-300 LOC); no Rust work. Orthogonal to all merge-producer variants. Catalog entry: `ideas/tokenizer-variants/README.md` variant 13. Decision-gated on force_merges d6 outcome.

All three smoke tests pass at d6/local scale (mechanism verification only). Next step is to train each on the full corpus, run `tools/eval_tokenizer.py` to compare, and pick survivors for a Lambda speedrun A/B.

The [non-backprop LLM](ideas/non-backprop/README.md) is a **separate research track**, not part of this capability-tuning sequence. Pursue independently.

## Next concrete steps

1. **Optional zloss val/bpb re-eval** — the d24 zloss run's val/bpb is inflated by ~0.004 due to the eval-path bug (since fixed). Either re-run for a citable number (~$80, one Lambda spin) or document the corrected value analytically (`0.71609 + noise`, matching baseline — derivable from the fix mechanics). The CORE win is unaffected; this is bookkeeping.

2. **Add smoke check (d) "eval-path equivalence" to MTP's smoke** — `mtp.py` honors the contract, but `wrappers/smoke_mtp.py` doesn't verify it. Copy the pattern from `wrappers/smoke_zloss.py` check (e). Cheap insurance against a future regression.

3. **Build the next overlay** — per sequencing, **deep supervision** (folds into the existing `MTPGPT` subclass, scaffolding already in place) or **token-level loss weighting** (entropy/focal — pure-loss overlay, no extra model). Deep supervision is the more natural next step; token weighting is a viable parallel cheap track if you want two signals in flight.

4. **Tokenizer-variants track (parallel, no GPU)** — three variants now smoke-pass at d6/local scale. Next: train each on the full corpus, run `tools/eval_tokenizer.py` to compare on Tier 1/2 metrics, pick survivors for a Lambda speedrun A/B alongside the next model-overlay trio.

5. After that: differential attention, then online data selection if the earlier results justify the harness-touching investment.
